# React - Day 5

## Reading

[Wes Bos - ES6 Block Scope is the new IIFE](https://wesbos.com/es6-block-scope-iife/)

## Assignment:

1. Add react router and use it in the app
2. Use the 'context' feature of React to be able to access prop in the first (parent) component to children nested at least 2 levels down (NOT the very next level).

- _Do not use the same example as the docs._
